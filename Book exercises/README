I am sorry about not including all of the exercises after the chapters. These exercises are great for learning the basics of various data types, how they are stored in memory, using macros, dicovering how to 'read' the errors that the compiler gives you, reading someone else's code also modifying it and of cource the syntax of C++. However consider that I am not a beginner and they are too simple and many for me to write. I will try to cover the ones that I consider resonable to do.
